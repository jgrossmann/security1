To run, follow instructions for running given in the homework submission guidelines.

Program Notes:

Any attempt at modification of /home or /tmp acl will result in no permission error.

Was not sure about this based on the guidelines, but the DELETE command actually deletes the file if it has the permissions to do so. 

Any blank line in the input file will be treated as an error.

If the ACL entry has any errors in it, the entire ACL will be skipped an the command to either CREATE or ACL will fail as an error.

Max line size in the file is 8192 bytes. I know users and groups should not have a limit on their size, but I believe that any line
bigger than 8192 bytes (even lines a good size smaller thatn 8192 bytes), has no plausible use case for this program.
